      "Two words are synonyms if they have very similar meanings. Synonyms represent the same type or category of thing. Here are some examples of synonym pairs: cup/mug, glasses/spectacles, envy/jealousy. In practice, word pairs that are not exactly synonymous may still be very similar. Here are some very similar pairs - we could say they are nearly synonyms: alligator/crocodile, love/affection, frog/toad. In contrast, although the following word pairs are related, they are not very similar. The words represent entirely different types of things: car/tyre, car/motorway, car/crash. Rate the semantic similarity of each word pair on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no semantic similarity, and 10 represents perfect semantic similarity. Remember, things that are related are not necessarily similar. If you are ever unsure, think back to the examples of synonymous pairs (glasses/spectacles), and consider how close the words are (or are not) to being synonymous.
